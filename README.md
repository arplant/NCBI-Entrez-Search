# NCBI Entrez Search
## Search using multiple terms and retrieve sequences as FASTA

This is a simple approach to retrieve records based on the search terms listed in a text file (input.txt).
For each record, the FASTA sequences is written to an appropriately-named output file.

Many thanks to the Biopython team, leadbot and others.
